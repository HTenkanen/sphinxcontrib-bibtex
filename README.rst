A Sphinx extension for bibtex style references.

sphinxcontrib-bibtex allows `BibTeX <http://www.bibtex.org/>`_
references to be inserted into documentation generated by
`Sphinx <http://sphinx.pocoo.org/>`_.
The extension adds a
``bibliography`` directive, and a ``cite`` role, which
work similarly to LaTeX's ``\bibliography`` and ``\cite`` commands.

 Inspired by
`bibstuff.sphinxext.bibref <https://github.com/matthew-brett/bibstuff>`_
by Matthew Brett.

Installation
------------

Install the module with ``pip install sphinxcontrib-bibtex``, or from
source using ``python setup.py install``. Then add::

   extensions = ['sphinxcontrib.bibtex']

to your project's Sphinx configuration file ``conf.py``.

Minimal Example
---------------

In your project's documentation, you can then write for instance::

   See :cite:`1987:nelson` for an introduction to non-standard analysis.

   .. bibliography:: refs.bib

where refs.bib would contain an entry::

   @Book{1987:nelson,
     author = {Edward Nelson},
     title = {Radically Elementary Probability Theory},
     publisher = {Princeton University Press},
     year = {1977},
     series = {Annals of Mathematical Studies}
   }
